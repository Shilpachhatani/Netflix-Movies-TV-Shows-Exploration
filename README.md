# üé¨ Netflix Movies & TV Shows Exploration

## üìå Project Overview & Task Objective

This `Netflix_Movies_TV_Shows_Exploration_Dev.ipynb` explores the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to uncover insights such as content distribution over time, type proportions (Movie vs TV Show), genre popularity, rating categories, content-producing countries, and content durations. The primary objective is to understand Netflix's content strategy using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## üìÇ Dataset Information

The project utilizes the `netflix_titles.csv` dataset, which contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. Key features include `show_id`, `type`, `title`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `listed_in` (genres), and `description`.

**Key Aspects:**
- Content distribution over time.
- Proportion of Movies vs. TV Shows.
- Popularity of different genres.
- Analysis of content ratings.
- Identification of top content-producing countries.
- Examination of content durations.

## ‚ú® Features

- Data loading and initial inspection.
- Handling missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize content trends.
- Analysis of content types (movies vs. TV shows).
- Investigation of genre popularity and distribution.
- Examination of content ratings and their prevalence.
- Identification of key countries contributing to Netflix content.
- Analysis of content duration for both movies and TV shows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To run this notebook locally, you will need Python installed along with the following libraries. You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib

## üöÄ Approach

My approach to exploring the Netflix dataset involved the following steps:

- **Library Import**: Imported essential Python libraries for data manipulation (pandas, numpy), and visualization (matplotlib, seaborn).
  
- **Data Loading**: Loaded the `netflix_titles.csv` dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
  - Handled missing values in relevant columns (e.g., `director`, `cast`, `country`).
  - Converted `date_added` to datetime objects for time-based analysis.
  - Extracted and processed genre information from the `listed_in` column.
    
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Analyzed the distribution of content types (Movie vs. TV Show).
  - Visualized content added over time to observe trends.
  - Explored the popularity of different genres using count plots.
  - Examined the distribution of content ratings.
  - Identified the top countries producing content for Netflix.
  - Analyzed the duration of movies and TV shows.
